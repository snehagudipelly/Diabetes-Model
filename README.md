## Diabetes Prediction Model Project

This project is a Python-based machine learning model for predicting diabetes using a dataset. Below are the instructions to set up and run the code.

## 1. Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


## 2. Dataset

 The dataset used is `diabetes.csv`.  
 Update the path to the dataset in the code if necessary:


# Update the path to your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('path/to/diabetes.csv')


## 3. Running the Code

To execute the notebook, open it with Jupyter:


jupyter notebook Diabetes_sneha.ipynb


Then run all the cells in order.

## 4. Code Structure

### Data Preprocessing
 Imports necessary libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
 Loads the dataset and displays basic data information.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Shows statistical insights and visualizations using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.

### Model Building
Builds a machine learning model using `scikit-learn`.
Trains the model and evaluates its performance.

### Prediction
Uses the trained model to predict diabetes cases.

## 5. API Usage (if applicable)
If the code includes API calls or endpoints, provide the endpoint and method details here.  
Example:


import requests

response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/predict', json=data)
print(response.json())


## 6. Notes
 Ensure the dataset path is correct.
 If any libraries are missing, install them using `pip`.
